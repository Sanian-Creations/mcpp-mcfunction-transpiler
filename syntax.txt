Comments.

	// line comment
	
	/*
	block comment
	contains loads of stuff
	*/


At the top of each file, define the namespace.

	namespace "something";
	

Functions are defined with the keyword 'function' followed by the name of the function.

	function something {

	}


Keyword '#load' adds this function to the load function tag.

	#load function main {
	
	}


Keyword '#tick' adds this function to the tick function tag.

	#tick function init {
	
	}


Keywords can be stacked but you probably shouldn't do that.

Manually write commands by starting a line with '/'.
A line still needs to end with ';' because this allows multi-line commands which can make readability much better.

	/execute as @a[tag=lmao] at @s
	  if entity @e[type=armor_stand,distance=..5]
	  if score @s temp matches 69
	  store result score NAME OBJECTIVE
	  run say "yoyoyo";


Alternatively, a 'raw' block pastes its content directly into the resulting files.
It's content isn't checked, so if you make a mistake you'll have to figure that out yourself!

	@{
		say hi
		tellraw @a "yoyoyo!"
		# mcfunction comment
		scoreboard players set @s temp 69
	}@


Single line if statements can be made

	if (x) /say hi;


Block if-statements can be made

	if (x) {
		//...
	}


Else is also supported

	if (x) {
		//...
	} else {
		//...
	}


Create loops

	while (x) {
		//...
		score i vars ++
	}

Essentially, every instance of { ... } gets turned into an mcfunction file,
with the exception of RAW blocks @{ ... }@
